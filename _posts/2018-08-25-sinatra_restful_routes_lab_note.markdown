Had a good chat with my non-technical coach. Got me on track to where I need to be mentally, if nothing else.

Knocked out the Sinatra RESTful Routes Lab.

Takeaway from this lab:

Remember to add the 'use Rack::MethodOverride' to the config.ru file above the line with  'run ApplicationController'.
