Had a good chat with my non-technical coach. Got me on track to where I need to be mentally, if nothing else.

Knocked out the Sinatra RESTful Routes Lab.

Takeaway from this lab:

Remember to add the `use Rack::MethodOverride` to the config.ru file above the line with  `run ApplicationController`.
