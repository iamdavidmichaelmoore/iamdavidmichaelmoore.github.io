<p>Hello! I'm David, and I am a teacher and U.S. Army reservist making a career change from teaching to a software developer. I live in South Florida - Fort Lauderdale Florida. I am passionate about learning to code and solve problems. Moreover, I enjoy seeing things I create contribute to real-world solutions in whatever area I am working.  So, I am eagerly learning to code so that I may develop applications that enhance people's lives in meaning ways.  Prior knowledge and experience: Python, Java, SQL, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
